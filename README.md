Case is a web application written using the Django Framework for Dr. Kenneth Lee and students studying Pharmacy at the University of Western Australia.

The purpose of the application is to allow students to populate a database with case studies that they have experienced, so that other users can attempt the case. Additionally it gives students an opportunity to try more cases, than currently available in the course.
